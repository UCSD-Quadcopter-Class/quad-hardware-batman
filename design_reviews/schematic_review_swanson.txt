Errors

1.  A bunch of nets in the middle of motor controllers are connected and tehy should not be (e.g., filtered, flyback, etc.)

2.  THe symbol for you mosfet is pretty hard to understand.  You usually ignore the shape of the physical part in designing the schematic symbol.

3.  THe 10KOhm resistors on the input filte to the motor contorller sohuld be 100OHms

4.  Your IMU symbol is hard to read.  Again, your symbols are more readable if your arrange the pins so related thingsa are together (E.g., SDA and SCL next to eachocher.)

5.  Decoupling cap sizes on your IMU are wrong.

6.  you have no custom LEDS




other notes


1.  It's conventional to draw decoupling caps (and caps in general) vertically.


2.  THe 1uF cap on the input filter to the motoro controllers hould be 0.1uF

3.  Gnd should alway be lower than power.  Putting gnd on top makes your power supply circuit very hard tou nderstand.

THe input filter for your motor controllers is not right.  You've swapped the resistor and the capacitor.  THe Cap should be between the PWM line and ground. and the resistor should be between the microcontroller and the capacitor.


C2 should be connected to BAT_GND
