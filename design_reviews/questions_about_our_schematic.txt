Design Review for Team Batman
------

Meeting time/place: 4/24/17 4pm SME 305

NOTE: You guys use the power labels “VCC” and “3V” but we used “VBAT” and “VCC”. We kept this in mind while checking the schematics.


Incorrect Motor Driver LED (?)
* SCHOT led used by the motor.sch but the value is way off compared to the one that is used by team batman
* This picture is from the Motor-Driver.sch, they also use a Schottky diode but the Voltage is a lot different from yours. (Were not sure if our Diode is correct either but its the Red-LED that we made in the previous labs)
*   



The Polarized Cap you used in the motor is 100uF. This matches the original schematic but we asked the prof. And he said to use the one provided (says 220uF)




Motor Driver Resistor (For example R6) is supposed to be 100Ohm but you used 10k.




Resistor is different at pins PB6 and PB7 (330 not 15). Probably added extra LED at PB4 (not on official schematic)


Connection of the CS a/g and CS M onto power instead of onto the vddio power
   *    
   * It says “connected to VDD_IO” (so we connected directly to the vdd_io line which has the capacitor->gnd also on the wire). You just connected it directly to power (but I dont think this is a big issue, just pointing it out).
   * Questions use of DEN_A/g . is it necessary and how do you know to turn it on


Why do you guys connect a Resistor and power to the SDA and SCL slots on the IMU. Diagram is not explicitly shown to do that. Where was the information found?


Why is SDO_A/G held high on the IMU?


On the 6 pin programmer -- MISO, SCK and RESET are missing labels


We calculated the resistance needed for the custom LED and it was 52 not 64. Used Vdrop of 2 and Current of 25.


Part design Review
9AXIS IMU -- might be touching, move out a little bit.
MOSFET and LED pass
Swapped width and heigh of the pads on the 0805 resistor
Need to extend LED pads by 1 mm.
